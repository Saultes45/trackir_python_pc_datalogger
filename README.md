# What is: trackir_python_pc_datalogger?

A python-based datalogger for the 6DOF pose data generated by TrackIR sofware

The python code is heavily based on John Tapsell's work 

# Only tested on a win7 x64 computer with python 3.7 (64bit)

python uses a SDK: from trackir import TrackIRDLL, (TrackIR_6DOF_Data,
logprint) but you need to have the trackIR app running in // as well !!!!

[OLD] To save to a log, 2 options

--> Do that in python (done)

--> in pyCharm: to save the console as log files automatically) follow the instructions from Pycharm to save console logs automatically: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46410577/intellij-idea-how-persist-console-output-to-file-programmatically



# Matlab Post-process parser/plotter TODO

## Data amelioration
1. Detect frame dropouts with variance

1. Save as quaternion

1. Filter using LERP/SLERP as quaternion ^

## Import amelioration
1. Pop up selection of the file to import ^

1. File name check, get runID

1. Detect all the good (LOG) files in a folder ^
