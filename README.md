% track IR:

% python uses a SDK: from trackir import TrackIRDLL, (TrackIR_6DOF_Data,
% logprint) but you need to have the trackIR app running in // as well !!!!

% [OLD] To save to a log, 2 options

%--> Do that in python (done)

%--> in pyCharm: to save the console as log files automatically) follow the instructions from Pycharm to save console logs automatically: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46410577/intellij-idea-how-persist-console-output-to-file-programmatically

# Matlab Post-process parser/plotter TODO

% --> Detect frame dropouts with variance

% --> Save as quaternion

% --> Filter using LERP/SLERP as quaternion ^


% -->  Pop up selection of the file to import ^

% -->  File name check, get runID

% -->  Detect all the good (LOG) files in a folder ^

^ means I have written this code for a another project
