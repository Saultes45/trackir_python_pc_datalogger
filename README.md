# What is: trackir_python_pc_datalogger?

The different codes in this repo are designed for **logging** and **plotting** the **6DoF** **pose** data generated by **TrackIR** sofware/hardware.

This repo contains **2 sets of code**: 

 1. A python-based datalogger 
 2. A Matlab-based post-processor 

Each set of code have its own subfolder.

# Important Notices

 - Only tested on a **win7 x64** computer with:
	 -  **python 3.7** (64bit)
	 -  Matlab 2020b (64bit)
 - The python code is **heavily** based on **John Tapsell's** work
 - In trackIR GUI, make sure the profile is **One:one**

# Ressources

1. Original github: https://github.com/johnflux/python_trackir

1. track IR (hardware): https://www.naturalpoint.com/trackir/

The python script uses a SDK imported in the python script as follows: 

    from trackir import TrackIRDLL, (TrackIR_6DOF_Data, logprint) 

but you need to have the **trackIR app running** while logging with the python script
  
# Saving the data 

**[OLD]** To save 6DOF data to a log file, 2 options:

 - Do that in python (done) 
 - In pyCharm: to save the console as log files
   automatically) follow the instructions from Pycharm to save console
   logs automatically:
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46410577/intellij-idea-how-persist-console-output-to-file-programmatically
   
**[NEW]** Now the data are stored in circular logs. File size is limited. All parameters are in the python file.

# Post-process parser/plotter TODO (Matlab)

## Data amelioration
1. Detect frame dropouts with variance
1. Save attitudes as quaternions
1. Filter using LERP/SLERP as quaternion ^

## Import amelioration
1. Pop up selection of the file to import ^
1. File name check, get runID
1. Detect all the good (LOG) files in a folder ^

^ means I have written this code for a another project
